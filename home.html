                            I am a tiny but chubby human. I don't get to go outside our house that much.
                            As I were a sickly child and doesn't like to interact with people.
                            I live with my Mom, Dad, grandma and grandpa. Me and my cousin
                            often fight as she likes to remove my toys in the way that I have arranged them.

                            I am much closer to my mother's side of the family. But I am also closer to my grandma and grandpa in my father's side. 
                            <br>Both sides enjoy to communicate with me and tend to give advice to me.
                            <br>
                            I know that they love me but just shy to express their feelings as in our culture we are know to not show our true emotions.

                            You can see that among these pictures I am in a different friend group.
                            This is because I don't really have friends to call on my own.
                            I tend to refuse making friends at school, I am closed-off.

                            During my highschool years I start to make friends that I can call close friends.
                            Especially during my senior highschool years, those friends that I made are now my best friends.

                            All of the cats here in this post, just one day appeared near our house and eventually we got to keep them.
                            They are all shy to people maybe they were absused before but as time passes by they became warm to us.
                            Sadly, Vonnie(upper left) died in a hit and run accident in front of our house. The rest of the cats here 
                            are named Kyro,Kyra and Potpot.

                            Blake or Blakey (upper left), is given to us from Sto. Tomas,Batangas. He is a Batangueño. He 
                            likes to mark our house with his pee as a sign that our house was his territory. He is a monotone 
                            siamese cat. Presto or Pesto-chan was the child of O-Chan (family of biscuits). Penny is a scottishfold
                            cat, she just showed up in our backyard. Rebisco or Biski (not a child of O-chan) was found and rescued 
                            by our cousin.

                            that is a breeder. They said Cloud was a persian or a siamese cat. The last one is Cream, she is one of 
                            the twins of Mimi, her twin Lava, was given to our neighboor.
